# HEIC-to-JPEG-or-PNG

I was creating a 3D model of myself using photos taken from my iphone. When RealityScan didn't like the HEIC format I found it easier to write a script than it was to pay for a converter
or retake the photos so I wrote these scripts and compared my model created using PNG to one I created using JPEG. Of course you will have to change the folder names to fit your directories.
I also took the liberty of stripping only the body from the image which helps a lot when creating a 3D model.
